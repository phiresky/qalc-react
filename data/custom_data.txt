# screen ratio calculation, i.e. how wide is a 27" screen with a ratio of 16:9
#
# (1) width^2 + height^2 = (diagonal^2)
# (2) width = ratio height
# 
# => w^2 + (w/ratio)^2 = d^2
# => 1 w^2 + (1/ratio^2) w^2 = d^2
# => (1 + 1/ratio^2) w^2 = d^2
# => w = d / sqrt(1 + 1/ratio^2)
# 
# Example:
# screenwidth (27inch) (16|9) to cm ≅ 60 cm
