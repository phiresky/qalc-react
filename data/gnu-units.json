				"5.5. Many astronomical values can be measured most accurately in a system of units\nusing the astronomical unit and the mass of the sun as base units. The\nuncertainty in the gravitational constant makes conversion to SI units\nsignificantly less accurate.\n\nThe astronomical unit was defined to be the length of the of the semimajor\naxis of a massless object with the same year as the earth. With such a\ndefinition in force, and with the mass of the sun set equal to one, Kepler's\nthird law can be used to solve for the value of the gravitational constant.\n\nKepler's third law says that (2 pi / T)^2 a^3 = G M where T is the orbital\nperiod, a is the size of the semimajor axis, G is the gravitational constant\nand M is the mass. With M = 1 and T and a chosen for the earth's orbit, we\nfind sqrt(G) = (2 pi / T) sqrt(AU^3). This constant is called the Gaussian\ngravitational constant, apparently because Gauss originally did the\ncalculations. However, when the original calculation was done, the value\nfor the length of the earth's year was inaccurate. The value used is called\nthe Gaussian year. Changing the astronomical unit to bring it into\nagreement with more accurate values for the year would have invalidated a\nlot of previous work, so instead the astronomical unit has been kept equal\nto this original value.

				"The following explanation for this\nvalue was provided by Wendy Krieger\n<os2fan2@yahoo.com> based on\nguesswork.  The cylindrical vessel is\n18.5 inches in diameter and 1|2 inch\nthick.  A heaped bushel includes the\ncontents of this cylinder plus a heap\non top.  The heap is a cone 19.5\ninches in diameter and 6 inches\nhigh.  With these values, the volume\nof the bushel is 684.5 pi in^3 and\nthe heap occupies 190.125 pi in^3.\nTherefore, the heaped bushel is\n874.625|684.5 bushels.  This value is\napproximately 1.2777575 and it rounds\nto the value listed for the size of\nthe heaped bushel.  Sometimes the\nheaped bushel is reported as 1.25\nbushels.  This same explanation gives\nthat value if the heap is taken to\nhave an 18.5 inch diameter."

In\n1963 it was defined to be the volume\noccupied by 10 pounds of distilled\nwater of density 0.998859 g/ml weighed\nin air of density 0.001217 g/ml\nagainst weights of density 8.136 g/ml.\nThis gives a value of approximately\n4.5459645 liters, but the old liter\nwas in force at this time.  In 1976\nthe definition was changed to exactly\n4.54609 liters using the new\ndefinition of the liter (1 dm^3)."

				"Sometimes called the Winchester Wine Gallon,\nit was legalized in 1707 by Queen Anne, and\ngiven the definition of 231 cubic inches.  It\nhad been in use for a while as 8 pounds of wine\nusing a merchant's pound, but the definition of\nthe merchant's pound had become uncertain.  A\npound of 15 tower ounces (6750 grains) had been\ncommon, but then a pound of 15 troy ounces\n(7200 grains) gained popularity.  Because of\nthe switch in the value of the merchants pound,\nthe size of the wine gallon was uncertain in\nthe market, hence the official act in 1707.\nThe act allowed that a six inch tall cylinder\nwith a 7 inch diameter was a lawful wine\ngallon.  (This comes out to 230.9 in^3.)\nNote also that in Britain a legal conversion\nwas established to the 1824 Imperial gallon\nthen taken as 277.274 in^3 so that the wine\ngallon was 0.8331 imperial gallons.  This is\n231.1 cubic inches (using the international\ninch)."
